here's an "edit " item on the Run menu, and on the pull-down to the left of the two green "run" and "debug" arrows on the toolbar. In that panel, you create a configuration with the "+" button in the top left, and then you can choose the Class containing main(), add VM parameters and command-line args, specify the working directory and any environment variables.

There are other options there as well: code coverage, logging, build, JRE, etc. item item salam
